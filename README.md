- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Nutonic, name is Max Brazao and I'm also on linkedin for a deeper profile https://www.linkedin.com/in/maxbrazao/. I'm the president and founder of Temple Selection, an executive search company, serving companies who look to hire best in class people.
- ðŸ‘€ I and Temple are a different type of search and recruitment professional. With over 20 years representing artists and engineers, leaders and operations in technology and product for multiple domains, I'm retained when all others fail to solve the hardest to secure positions. I typically employ headhunt directly techniques (called woo and court in industry), as well as other leading best in class inroduction and negotiation services. In this proccess, being highly respectfully for companies and people in the journey is necessary. People and companies trust us for truth, transparancy and confidentiality. I and we, "lay it out for all concerned" so clear closiing decisions can be made by you, on your career as well as our clients. Typically I work on an exclusive or retained basis with external clients.
