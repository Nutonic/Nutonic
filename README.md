- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Nutonic, name is Max Brazao and I'm also on linkedin for a deeper profile. I'm the president and founder of Temple Selection, an executive search company, serving companies who look to hire best in class people.
- ðŸ‘€ I and Temple are a different type of search and recruitment professional. With over 20 years representing artists and engineers, leaders and operations in technology for multiple domains, enterprise to SME. I typically only headhunt directly and highly respectfully in the journey. People and companies trust me for truth, transparancy and confidentiality and to "lay it out" so clear closing decisions can be made on your career. People will tell you I say what I mean and my word is my bond, always. Typically I work on an exclusive or retained basis with external clients.
